# Modular_Legal_RAG
This repository contains the code and data associated with the EDA, the Modular RAG system's construction and LLM inference of both GPT3.5-Turbo & LLama 3 8B-Instruct, and the evaluation pipeline. 

The system was used for large-scale and automated analysis via LLMs of PDF court statements from Rechtspraak.nl related to Criminal Court cases for PGP-systems (Encrochat, Sky ECC, ANOM, PGP-Safe, EnnetCom).
The system includes multiple iterations of retrieval and includes 
* Re-Ranking
* Re-ordering
* LLM-judges
* Groundness and Hallucination Checks
* Feedback loop.
